## Problem

Create a React Native frontend with a Node (micro) backend that allows a customer to browse a list of vehicle, see vehicle details, and submit an order.

A barebones service has been provided by running `npm start` within ./server. Look at its code to understand the API you will be consuming.

### Required Views

1. Vehicle List
2. Vehicle Details
3. Success Page

### Guidelines

1. Check into Git periodically
2. Use whichever libraries you like
3. Take 1-2 hours on it
4. Document your assumptions, describe what else would need to be done to make it "production-ready."

### What We Are Looking For

1. Coding style
2. Knowledge of React Native, JS or aptitude to quickly pick it up and contribute on a React Native project.
